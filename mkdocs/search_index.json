The ID-software comprises end-user applications, software libraries, web components, drivers for communicating with the cryptographic tokens and other complementary components.  \n\n\nMain sources for information about ID-software are \nwww.id.ee\n and \nOpen-EID GitHub repository\n. \n\n\nThis document covers description of ID-software and its components, their deployment in different environments, provided and required interfaces. The document does not include components that have reached the end of their support nor the components that have not yet been released.  \n\n\nThe document is based on the latest released state of the ID-software components. At the time of writing, the latest released version of ID-software is \nversion 3.12\n. Latest version numbers of the various ID-software components are provided at \nhttp://www.id.ee/?lang=en&id=36798\n.\n\n\nThe document is targeted for:\n\n\n\n\nOwners/managers of the software;\n\n\nContractors;\n\n\nContributors interested in developing ad-hoc solutions;\n\n\nIntegrators/software developers interested in integrating the software with third-party information systems;\n\n\nInternational audience \u2013 contributors/integrators from countries other than Estonia who wish to use the software internationally and/or contribute in its development.\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nThe main owner/manager of the ID-software is Estonian Information System Authority (RIA, \nhttps://www.ria.ee/en/\n).\n\nMain contractor for developing the software is AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus (SK, \nhttps://sk.ee/en\n). In case of a few of the components, SK is also the owner.  \n\n\nDevelopment of ID-software has been mainly done in Estonia, however, the ID-software is released for international usage.\n\nThe software is distributed open-source (mainly under LGPL/BSD licence) and is accessible from the following locations:\n\n\n\n\nGitHub repository for the source code, wiki documentation, beta and (optionally) production versions of binary packages: \nhttps://github.com/open-eid\n.\n\n\nRelease repository for production versions of binaries: \nhttps://installer.id.ee/\n\n\n\n\nID-software components can be logically divided in the following groups:\n\n\n\n\nDesktop applications\n for end-users;\n\n\nSoftware libraries\n for integrators/software developers to integrate the libraries\u2019 functionality with third-party information systems/applications;\n\n\nWeb components\n for integrators/software developers to add the signature creation and authentication functionality in web environment to third-party web applications;\n\n\nDrivers\n for communication with the cryptographic tokens that conduct the PKI operations;\n\n\nOther (supportive) components\n for packaging, installation, updating and centrally managing changes of the configuration settings in software (with the central configuration service).\n\n\n\n\nThe following table maps the main ID-software components, their owner/developer (i.e. the main contractor) and the functionality they offer.\n\n\nTable: Mapping of ID-software components and functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwner/  \nDeveloper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling BDOC documents\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling DDOC documents\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling CDOC documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating RSA signature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard management operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesktop applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigiDoc3 Client (incl.

ID-software  is a collection of software components offering support for PKI-based functionality, i.e. operations with different cryptographic tokens (e.g. eID cards), handling digitally signed documents, file encryption/decryption and signing and authentication in web environment. The ID-software comprises end-user applications, software libraries, web components, drivers for communicating with the cryptographic tokens and other complementary components.    Main sources for information about ID-software are  www.id.ee  and  Open-EID GitHub repository .   This document covers description of ID-software and its components, their deployment in different environments, provided and required interfaces. The document does not include components that have reached the end of their support nor the components that have not yet been released.    The document is based on the latest released state of the ID-software components. At the time of writing, the latest released version of ID-software is  version 3.12 . Latest version numbers of the various ID-software components are provided at  http://www.id.ee/?lang=en&id=36798 .  The document is targeted for:   Owners/managers of the software;  Contractors;  Contributors interested in developing ad-hoc solutions;  Integrators/software developers interested in integrating the software with third-party information systems;  International audience \u2013 contributors/integrators from countries other than Estonia who wish to use the software internationally and/or contribute in its development.",
