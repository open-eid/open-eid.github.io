ID-software is a collection of software components offering support for PKI-based functionality, i.e. operations with different cryptographic tokens (e.g. eID cards), handling digitally signed documents, file encryption/decryption and signing and authentication in web environment. The ID-software comprises end-user applications, software libraries, web components, drivers for communicating with the cryptographic tokens and other complementary components. Main sources for information about ID-software are www.id.ee and Open-EID GitHub repository . This document covers description of ID-software and its components, their deployment in different environments, provided and required interfaces. The document does not include components that have reached the end of their support nor the components that have not yet been released. The document is based on the latest released state of the ID-software components. At the time of writing, the latest released version of ID-software is version 20.09 . Latest version numbers of the various ID-software components are provided at https://www.id.ee/en/article/information-on-the-latest-software-versions/ . The document is targeted for: Owners/managers of the software; Contractors; Contributors interested in developing ad-hoc solutions; Integrators/software developers interested in integrating the software with third-party information systems; International audience \u2013 contributors/integrators from countries other than Estonia who wish to use the software internationally and/or contribute in its development. Background Estonian Information System Authority (RIA, https://www.ria.ee/en.html ) is the main owner/manager of the ID-software. The software is being developed and tested by: RaulWalter (RW, https://www.raulwalter.com ) as the main contractor during 2019-2022; Nortal ( https://nortal.com ) during 2019-2020; TTT ( https://www.testijad.ee ) during 2019-2022; SK ID Solutions (SK, https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en ); Aktors ( http://www.aktors.ee/wp/ ); CGI Estonia ( https://www.cgi.ee/et ). Development of ID-software has been mainly done in Estonia, however, the ID-software is released for international usage. The software is distributed open-source (mainly under LGPL/BSD licence) and is accessible from the following locations: GitHub repository for the source code, wiki documentation, beta and (optionally) production versions of binary packages: https://github.com/open-eid . Release repository for production versions of binaries: https://www.id.ee/en/article/install-id-software/ ID-software components can be logically divided in the following groups: Desktop applications for end-users; Mobile applications for end-users; Software libraries for integrators/software developers to integrate the libraries\u2019 functionality with third-party information systems/applications; Web components for integrators/software developers to add the signature creation and authentication functionality in web environment to third-party web applications; Drivers for communication with the cryptographic tokens that conduct the PKI operations; Other (supportive) components for packaging, installation, updating and centrally managing changes of the configuration settings in software (with the central configuration service). The following table maps the main ID-software components, their owner/developer (i.e. the main contractor) and the functionality they offer.

(2) - The component is used only once for setting the proper parameters for authentication in Firefox browser. (3) - The utility is used to timestamp BDOC 1.0 or DDOC documents - it creates a ASiC-S container with RFC 3161 timestamp token applied to the original BDOC or DDOC document. (4) - PADES handling is not supported. The main functions offered by ID-software are described in the following table: Function Description Handling ASiC/BDOC/PADES documents Handling documents in BDOC 2.1 digital signature format that is a profile of ETSI XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signature) and ETSI ASiC formats. Validating timestamp and signatures of enclosed DDOC document in the Time Stamp Token (TST) based ETSI ASIC-S containers. Validating the signatures of PDF documents in PAdES digital signature format that is a profile of ETSI PAdES . More information on the formats\u2019 life cycle can be found from https://www.id.ee/en/article/digidoc-container-format-life-cycle-2/ . See Libdigidocpp and Digidoc4j documentation for supported formats. Handling DDOC documents Handling documents in DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 (DDOC) digital signature format that is a profile of ETSI XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signature) format. More information on the formats\u2019 life cycle can be found from https://www.id.ee/en/article/digidoc-container-format-life-cycle-2/ . Handling CDOC documents Encrypting and decrypting documents in ENCDOC-XML 1.0 (CDOC) also CDOC 1.1 format. Calculating RSA/ECDSA signature Calculating the RSA or ECDSA signature value in browser or desktop/server environment. The operation involves connecting with the signature token\u2019s driver, sending the data to be signed and receiving digital signature value calculated with the token owner\u2019s RSA or ECDSA private key. The following cryptographic tokens are supported: hardware-based tokens (e.g. PKCS#11-based eID cards, USB cryptostick, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID); software-based tokens (e.g. PKCS#12 software token). Card management operations PIN/PUK management, reading personal data file. Authentication Authentication with ID-card. The operation is generally done via native operating system/browser components. In case of Estonian ID-cards and Firefox browser, a PKCS#11 module loader script is used for setting the proper parameters for authentication in Firefox browser.
