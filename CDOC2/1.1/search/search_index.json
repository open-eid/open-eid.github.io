The purpose of the section is to familiarize the reader with basic principles of encryption schemes and to specify, how the cryptographic primitives and other functions are used to compose CDOC2 encryption schemes. However, in this section, encryption schemes are presented in abstract form and they are missing some details. For example, iteration count of PBKDF2 function is not defined here and additional arguments for the HKDF functions are not defined in this section. Such implementation details are specified in Cryptographic protocol details.</p> <p>Encryption schemes are presented in an abstract form, where Sender wants to send a message <code>M</code> (payload of the CDOC2 Container) to total of <code>l</code> Recipients (<code>Recipient_1</code>, <code>Recipient_2</code>, ... <code>Recipient_l</code>) and Recipients are all similar, in a sense that they all have similar RSA key pairs or that they all have established a password with Sender. In the actual CDOC2 system, Sender may mix different kind of Recipients and different encryption schemes may be concurrently used in the same CDOC2 Container. In that sense, encryption schemes defined in this section are not comparable to use-cases, which describe interaction details of user and CDOC2 system software components.

This may cause the application to crash when the recipient processes this payload in memory. It can cause disk space to run out when written to disk. The pragmatic solution is to set a maximum size limit for unpacked files and continuously monitor free memory or free disk space during unpacking. If the files being unpacked are larger than permitted or free memory or free disk space has decreased below the permitted limit, unpacking must be aborted, files written to the disk in the process deleted, and the error reported.</p> <p>Attack 2: The attacker may manipulate the attributes of the files in the tar archive \u2013 file names, permission bits, security attributes and types.

If a file name containing unpermitted symbols is found, abort unpacking, delete files written to the disk before this point, and return an error message.</li> </ul> <p>File name safety verification serves the following purposes:</p> <ul> <li>Prevention of path traversal attacks and creation of files outside the folder selected by the user.</li> <li>Prevention of the creation of files with names containing special symbols, inaccessible or difficult to access for the user.</li> </ul> <p>Different operating systems have different requirements for file names.

This could complement password-based encryption schemes in CDOC2 System.</li> <li>Use YubiKey security token (or any other smart-card compatible token) as a symmetric encryption key provider, based on EC key pair and ECDH key establishment protocols, for long-term storage crypto. This could add to password-based encryption schemes in CDOC2 System.</li> </ol> <p>Current recommendation is to further study the options 2 and 3 and to work out approximate estimates for integration and development efforts. As option 2 is also supported by Security Key Series, which are somewhat cheaper than YubiKey 5 series (https://www.yubico.com/ee/store/compare/), the priority should be on option 2.</p>"}]}
