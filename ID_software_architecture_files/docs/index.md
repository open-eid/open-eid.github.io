# <a name="home">ARCHITECTURE OF ID-SOFTWARE</a>

Document version: 2.0  
Software version: 20.01  
Last updated: 31.12.2019  


# <a name="_intro">Introduction</a>

The purpose of this document is to describe the architecture of ID-software.

**ID-software** is a collection of software components offering support for PKI-based functionality, i.e. operations with different cryptographic tokens (e.g. eID cards), handling digitally signed documents, file encryption/decryption and signing and authentication in web environment. The ID-software comprises end-user applications, software libraries, web components, drivers for communicating with the cryptographic tokens and other complementary components.

Main sources for information about ID-software are [www.id.ee](http://id.ee/?lang=en&id=) and [Open-EID GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-eid).

This document covers description of ID-software and its components, their deployment in different environments, provided and required interfaces. The document does not include components that have reached the end of their support nor the components that have not yet been released.

The document is based on the latest released state of the ID-software components. At the time of writing, the latest released version of ID-software is **version 20.01**. Latest version numbers of the various ID-software components are provided at [http://www.id.ee/?lang=en&id=36798](http://www.id.ee/?lang=en&id=36798).

The document is targeted for:

*   Owners/managers of the software;
*   Contractors;
*   Contributors interested in developing ad-hoc solutions;
*   Integrators/software developers interested in integrating the software with third-party information systems;
*   International audience – contributors/integrators from countries other than Estonia who wish to use the software internationally and/or contribute in its development.


# <a name="_background">Background</a>

**Estonian Information System Authority** (RIA, [https://www.ria.ee/en.html](https://www.ria.ee/en.html)) is the main owner/manager of the ID-software.  

The software is being developed and tested by:  

*   **RaulWalter** (RW, [https://www.raulwalter.com](https://www.raulwalter.com)) as the main contractor during 2019-2022;  
*   **Nortal** ([https://nortal.com](https://nortal.com)) during 2019-2020;  
*   **TTT** ([https://www.testijad.ee](https://www.testijad.ee)) during 2019-2022;  
*   SK ID Solutions (SK, [https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en](https://www.skidsolutions.eu/en));  
*   Aktors ([http://www.aktors.ee/wp/](http://www.aktors.ee/wp/));  
*   CGI Estonia ([https://www.cgi.ee/et](https://www.cgi.ee/et)).

Development of ID-software has been mainly done in Estonia, however, the ID-software is released for international usage.
The software is distributed open-source (mainly under LGPL/BSD licence) and is accessible from the following locations:

*   GitHub repository for the source code, wiki documentation, beta and (optionally) production versions of binary packages: [https://github.com/open-eid](https://github.com/open-eid).
*   Release repository for production versions of binaries: [https://installer.id.ee/](https://installer.id.ee/)

ID-software components can be logically divided in the following groups:

*   **Desktop applications** for end-users;
*   **Mobile applications** for end-users;
*   **Software libraries** for integrators/software developers to integrate the libraries’ functionality with third-party information systems/applications;
*   **Web components** for integrators/software developers to add the signature creation and authentication functionality in web environment to third-party web applications;
*   **Drivers** for communication with the cryptographic tokens that conduct the PKI operations;
*   **Other (supportive) components** for packaging, installation, updating and centrally managing changes of the configuration settings in software (with the central configuration service).

The following table maps the main ID-software components, their owner/developer (i.e. the main contractor) and the functionality they offer.

**Table: Mapping of ID-software components and functions**

Remarks:

(1) - The functionality is provided via base components.  
(2) - The component is used only once for setting the proper parameters for authentication in Firefox browser.  
(3) - The utility is used to timestamp BDOC 1.0 or DDOC documents - it creates a ASiC-S container with RFC 3161 timestamp token applied to the original BDOC or DDOC document.  
(4) - PADES handling is not supported.  



The main functions offered by ID-software are described in the following table:

| Function | Description |

| Calculating RSA/ECDSA signature | Calculating the RSA or ECDSA signature value in browser or desktop/server environment. The operation involves connecting with the signature token’s driver, sending the data to be signed and receiving digital signature value calculated with the token owner’s RSA or ECDSA private key. The following cryptographic tokens are supported: hardware-based tokens (e.g. PKCS#11-based eID cards, USB cryptostick, Mobile-ID and Smart-ID); software-based tokens (e.g. PKCS#12 software token). |
| Card management operations | PIN/PUK management, reading personal data file. |
| Authentication | Authentication with ID-card. The operation is generally done via native operating system/browser components. In case of Estonian ID-cards and Firefox browser, a PKCS#11 module loader script is used for setting the proper parameters for authentication in Firefox browser. |

# <a name="_component_model">Component model</a>

The following chapter depicts ID-software component diagrams, including variations of the components used in different supported environments.  
In the context of the component diagrams in this document, the ID-software components have been divided to two different packages to show the component’s owner:

*   Components of ID-software that are owned and operated by RIA: <u>placed in "RIA" package</u>.
*   Components of ID-software that are owned and operated by SK: <u>placed in "SK" package</u>.

Other components are regarded as external to ID-software.  
Note that not all of the external base libraries are included in the component model to avoid duplicity with other documentation – the base libraries are listed and described in the documentation of the respective ID-software components and can be accessed via the references provided.

# <a name="_deployment_model">Deployment model</a>

The following subchapters describe physical deployment of ID-software components in collaboration with external components that were depicted in chap. [Component model](#_component_model) in case of the most common use cases.

<a name="_deploy_web"></a>
## Signing in web browser

**Figure: Signing in web browser via a web application**

Additional notes:

*   A digital signing software library (i.e. DigiDoc4j or Libdigidocpp) can be used for creating a ASiC container and adding the created signature value to the container.
*   Long term validation data is added to the ASiC signature by obtaining OCSP confirmation and a time-stamp.
*   Mobile-ID REST services is required in order to sign with Mobile-ID.
*   Smart-ID REST services is required in order to sign with Smart-ID.
*   Signature value is calculated either in the Mobile-ID SIM card, Smart-ID mobile application or eID-card’s chip.
*   When signing with eID smartcard then the browser signing module is necessary for enabling communication with the smart card connected to the user’s system. Hwcrypto.js library offers a single API for supporting signing modules of all the supported browsers.
*   Optionally, trust anchor data is retrieved from TSL lists – the European Commission’s central TSL and national TSL’s of the EU member states.
